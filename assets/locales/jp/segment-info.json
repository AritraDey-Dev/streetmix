          "Urban planners and architects have spent a few decades trying to learn what happens in people’s brains when they figure out how to get from point A to point B – or how they even know where “point A” is to begin with. As early as 1960, urban planner Kevin Lynch wrote of the “legibility” of the city in his book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Image-Harvard-MIT-Center-Studies-Series/dp/0262620014\">The Image of the City</a></em>, describing wayfinding as “a consistent use and organization of definite sensory cues from the external environment.” It could be intangible – smell, touch, a sense of gravity or even electric or magnetic fields. Or it could be much more physical, with intentionally designed “wayfinding devices” like maps, street numbers, or route signs.",
          "It’s surprising how readily acceptable it is for ample signage to cater to car travel, with less of this investment made at the pedestrian level. Maybe it’s because it’s easier for us to stand still, take stock of our surroundings, and use our senses without fear of accidentally causing a six-person pileup behind us. At any rate, urban designers have pushed for pedestrian-friendly wayfinding signage, particularly in walkable commercial neighborhoods, and these signs have become branding opportunities in addition to being functional. For example, New York City <a href=\"https://www.pentagram.com/work/walknyc/story\">hired an internationally renowned design consultant</a> to create the now ubiquitous WalkNYC signs (Streetmix has modeled its segments after these). Other municipalities have adopted a traditional old-town or civic-formal take (pictured above), and some places have chosen to use <a href=\"http://walkyourcity.org/\">guerrilla wayfinding tactics.</a>",
          "After all, there’s nothing worse than being lost. As Lynch wrote: “The very word <em>lost</em> in our language means much more than simple geographical uncertainty; it carries overtones of utter disaster.” And who wants to be on the street feeling like that?"

          "In 2005, San Francisco-based design studio <a href=\"http://rebargroup.org/\">Rebar</a> temporarily converted a single metered parking space on downtown Mission Street into a tiny public park. The first parklet was simple: just a bench and a tree on a rectangular piece of turf, but it featured a brief instruction manual and a charge for others to make their own. With people realizing that so much of public space was really devoted to storing cars, an international movement was born, and now, the annual <a href=\"http://parkingday.org/\">Park(ing) Day</a> hosts nearly a thousand temporarily converted spots around the world.",
          "Knowing a good idea when it sees one, San Francisco became the first city to make parklets official with its <a href=\"http://sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org/\">Pavement to Parks program</a> in 2010. Today, the City by the Bay has over 50 parklets, many of which are now architecturally designed objects much improved beyond Rebar’s modest prototype. There’s an ambitious, corporate-sponsored two-block-long parklet in the heart of San Francisco’s busiest shopping corridor, and also a collection of movable, bright red “parkmobiles” (Streetmix’s default look) designed for the <a href=\"http://www.ybcbd.org/\">Yerba Buena Community Benefit District</a>. Official parklet programs now exist in many other cities in North America, such as Philadelphia, Oakland, Kansas City, New York, Chicago, and Vancouver, and many more cities are soon to follow."

          "On the historical timeline of personal transportation vehicles – horses on one end, and, say, Segways on the other – automobiles and bicycles have been the dominant warring tribes of public streets for nearly a century. Despite all the cars taking up so much room, though, there’s more bicycles than anything else in the world: more than a billion, as estimated by Worldometers, and nine million in Beijing, according to folk singer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Million_Bicycles\">Katie Melua</a>, where bicycling accounts for 32% of all trips.",
          "While most jurisdictions allow bicycles to share the road with motor vehicles (“A person riding a bicycle… has all the rights and is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle” <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=21200.\">says the California Vehicle Code</a>, in one particular instance) it goes without saying that most cyclists prefer to be in their own lane. It’s safer, for one thing. And because it’s safer, it actually encourages more bikers. And more bikers means healthier citizens, reduced carbon emissions, higher traffic throughput, and congestion mitigation. The <a href=\"https://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/Bicycling_and_the_Economy-Econ_Impact_Studies_web.pdf\">economic benefits accrue as well</a>: less money spent on automobile infrastructure (like bridges, roadways, and parking), and with the ability to fit more people on a road, it leads to more business in commercial corridors.",
          "Bike lane design can be extremely varied. Using medians, planters, bollards, or even parking lanes create better protection between bikes and cars. When lanes are painted green, it shows their city’s commitment to a continuous bike lane, and synchronized signal light timing to limit bike stops are called a “green wave.” For more information, check out the <a href=\"http://nacto.org/cities-for-cycling/design-guide/\">NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide</a>."
