    <h1>In case you missed it...</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>We made this “What’s new” box.</strong> Now you know that when something
        changes, we did it on purpose!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added “flex zone” items,</strong> which are modern uses of curb space
        that include taxi and rideshare pickup/dropoff, food trucks, bikeshare stations,
        and a waiting area where a guy just stands around looking at his modern portable device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tooltips on street components</strong> now help you differentiate between
        all the cars that look the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>More languages!</strong> Multilingual Streetmix continues on with Chinese,
        in both traditional and simplified flavors. 饮胜！
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed a crash bug</strong> that sometimes happens right after moving
        a street component around, which is literally the worst time for it to crash.
